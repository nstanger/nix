# nix flake configuration

## nix-darwin bootstrap on a new machine

1. Install `nix` using the Determinate Systems installer:

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
   ```

   > **Don‚Äôt install with the `--determinate` switch!** In the true spirit of Nix, there is a confusing distinction between the **Determinate Nix Installer** and **Determinate Nix**. The former can install either ‚Äúplain‚Äù or ‚ÄúDeterminate‚Äù Nix (using the `--determinate` switch). The latter is a downstream distribution of Nix that includes `nixd`. This is known to not play well with `nix-darwin` and in my experience it also deletes `/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.darwin-store.plist`, which sets up the Nix store mount. Obviously this borks Nix completely until you can manually re-mount the store (see below)!

2. Start a `git` shell:

   ```sh
   nix shell nixpkgs#git

   # or: nix-shell -p git
   ```

3. Clone the flake:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nstanger/nix.git
   ```

4. Assuming system and user names are correct, `cd` into the flake repo and bootstrap the flake:

   ```sh
   # prevent griping about "Unexpected files in /etc"
   sudo mv /etc/nix/nix.conf /etc/nix/nix.conf.before-nix-darwin
   sudo mv /etc/shells /etc/shells.before-nix-darwin
   sudo mv /etc/zshenv /etc/zshenv.before-nix-darwin

   nix build --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" ./#darwinConfigurations.[system name].system
   # e.g., nix build --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" ./#darwinConfigurations.poldavia.system
   ./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake /path/to/flake/repo
   # e.g., ./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/Documents/Development/nix/.#
   ```

   If there is a ‚ÄúProblem with the SSL CA cert‚Äù, during the initial `nix build`, check the solutions in this issue: <https://github.com/nixos/nix/issues/2899>. this usually happens if starting again after wiping a previous `nix` installation, which can leave dangling links as per <https://github.com/nixos/nix/issues/2899#issuecomment-1669501326>. You need to `sudo rm /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` again before `darwin-rebuild switch` as otherwise it complains about the file being in the way.

5. Profit!

## nix-darwin bootstrap on an existing machine

As above, but before cloning and bootstrapping the flake, uninstall Homebrew (as per <https://github.com/homebrew/install#uninstall-homebrew>):

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/Homebrew
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/Frameworks
```

or if you‚Äôre feeling lucky, just remove all the packages, but this may not always work cleanly:

```sh
brew remove --force $(brew list --cask) --ignore-dependencies
brew remove --force $(brew list --formula) --ignore-dependencies
```

Theoretically you should be able to migrate an existing Homebrew installation by setting `nix-homebrew.autoMigrate = true`, but I‚Äôm wary of it working cleanly:

```text
Warning: /usr/local seems to contain an existing copy of Homebrew.
==> Looks like an Intel installation (Homebrew repository is under the 'Homebrew' subdirectory)
==> There are two ways to proceed:
==> 1. Use the official uninstallation script to remove Homebrew (you will lose all taps and installed packages)
==> 2. Set nix-homebrew.autoMigrate = true; to allow nix-homebrew to migrate the installation
==> During auto-migration, nix-homebrew will delete the existing installation while keeping installed packages.
```

Reinstalling from scratch should be much cleaner.

Other issues:

* `mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.old` and `mv ~/.zshenv ~/.zshenv.old` probably makes sense to ensure things are clean. (If there is an existing `~/.zshrc.d` then this can probably also be removed, or at least emptied.) **Check for machine-specific initialisations that may need to be migrated.**
* Existing apps in `/Applications` may need to be manually removed to avoid clashes.
* If you get an error like `SHA.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched (got handshake key 0xf880080, needed 0xc400080)` then `rm -rf ~/Library/perl5` and try again. (Nix is getting confused over Perl versions.)
* Homebrew cask installs through Nix can be extremely slow (looking at you, Calibre üò†) as they are usually downloaded from the original website, with highly variable bandwidth. This is particularly bad on the first `switch` üôÅ as Nix doesn‚Äôt print download progress (perhaps `-verbose`?). Doing an initial `brew fetch` of all the casks might help somewhat (i.e., `brew fetch --force --casks [list]`)‚Äîit‚Äôs no faster but at least displays download progress by default. Formulae seems to be just as slow, but there aren‚Äôt many these and they‚Äôre only installed as dependencies of other things. It‚Äôs probably sensible to save a copy of the downloaded cache (located at `~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downlads`).

## Update flake to latest stable

**Never change the value of `home-manager.stateVersion`!**

In theory, just change the version number in all `nixpkgs` references in `flake.nix` (e.g., `23.11` ‚Üí `24.05`), then

```sh
nix flake update
nixswitch
```

If you get errors like:

```sh
error: cannot link '/nix/store/.tmp-link-59633-1986182875' to '/nix/store/.links/068x3y3a6lhjiixbmxx1wrg3lbxhq37blnlxp03038qvhdg0kcvc': File exists
error: some substitutes for the outputs of derivation '/nix/store/...' failed (usually happens due to networking issues); try '--fallback' to build derivation from source
```
first try a few times to see whether it eventually resolves itself. The number of packages built usually goes down each time. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try setting `auto-optimise-store = false` in `/etc/nix/nix.conf` followed by `nix store optimise`, then re-enable `auto-optimise-store`. (This may no longer be an issue with Determinate Nix?)

## If a macOS update borks Nix

See <https://gist.github.com/meeech/0b97a86f235d10bc4e2a1116eec38e7e>. It appears that `diskutil` wants the UUID of the Nix Store volume to be in upper case.

Some possible causes of borkage include:

* Overwriting `/etc/zshrc`.
* Deleting `/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.darwin-store.plist`. (I‚Äôm looking at you, `determinate-nixd` üòí.)
* Messing with `/etc/synthetic.conf`.

If things get **really** borked, you might not even have a proper path to fix things (e.g., things like `mount` and `diskutil` might be missing). This command should get enough things working again:

```sh
eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
```

## Fix stalled post-build on macOS Sequoia

As per <https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer/issues/1479#issuecomment-2754661175>:

```sh
sudo launchctl list | ag determinate
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/systems.determinate.nix-store
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/systems.determinate.nix-daemon
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/systems.determinate.nix-installer.nix-hook
```
